# Introduction

## A love-hate relationship

I never studied functional programming (FP) at university and until few years ago it was just a
fancy word that appeared on some random blogs. It's only after a long while that I discovered the
Scala language. I was quickly captured by it and I wanted to know more and be fluent. So I hit
"functional programming" and I discovered it was not at all just a fancy word! As quick as my
interest grew also my frustration did# because I found out that, for me at least, information is
very spread around (blogs, videos, books, libraries etc.) and that I could find only extremes: very
basic stuff or extremely complicated mathy contents "way beyond human comprehension".

What I couldn't find was a place that told me what I was supposed to learn, in what order and that
could explain concepts focusing on their intuition and usability rather than tasters or graduate
papers.

To put it short, this project is born from a personal struggle where I had to find my way to learn
functional programming. I thought it would be very useful to share the knowledge I built about
**learning** functional programming.

## Targets

What I want to achieve with this project is to put together **in a structured way** the information
that is already publicly available and to top it up with my personal comments, notes and ideas and
with examples and exercises to make the life of people that want to get into FP easier.

I want to focus on **functional programming applied to Scala** and Scala only, although there will
be multiple references to materials in Haskell.

I also want to dig deep and go as far as possible, including **advanced concepts** like category
theory.

At the end I want the reader to be able to **understand** most of the material that can be found
online so that one can be independent in his or her own research.

Also, this project will focus on **giving concepts and information** that are useful to understand
libraries like Cats, scalaz and Shapeless that, if you've never done FP before, can be really
obscure and not understandable. Although, now, some of them have very good documentation focused on
usage.

To get to this point I want to do my best to **provide intuition** of the concepts and to connect
them to real world problems that they solve. The more you will progress with FP, the more the
concept will become abstract and the more it will become increasingly difficult to keep in touch
with "the real world". A very common question I asked myself several times is "what do I even need
this for?". I want this kind of question to be fully answered and to provide sound foundations of
concepts and tools.

I want to use **a step-by-step approach** where I guide the reader from no prior knowledge of FP to
get the grasp of the most advanced topics. I will introduce concepts little by little, providing
understanding and intuition behind each of them and also what real world problems they solve. I will
only assume that the reader is already well grounded in other programming paradigms.

Overall, what I want the reader to achieve is:

* to be familiar in most of the FP concepts and know their purpose, from the simplest to the more
  advanced ones;
* become autonomous and be able to use online material;
* write functional code in Scala;
* be able to use the most common FP libraries.

## Why Scala

Why Scala.... For a few reasons. I like the JVM, it's a solid and tested platform that's been around
for several years, it has great adoption on the market and it will keep this position for many years
to come thanks to Java. Scala and Java can exchange libraries and this is a big kickstart for Scala
because of the vast code base already available. I (mostly) like its syntax, its terseness and
expressive power, I like the language features. I like the community around it and the problems that
are solved by languages like Scala.

However with Scala it's been really annoying for me to learn FP because the vast majority of the
content found around is for Haskell. Haskell is *the* authority on FP and for good reasons, I'm not
denying that. But I see no reason why I should learn one language to learn another language. It
would be a bit like going from London to Edinburgh via Paris. Sure you can do it but... I don't want
to learn Haskell! I want to learn Scala!

So this is also to have good, complete materials in Scala.

With time I also hope that more languages will be added by other people. Languages like Haskell
itself or F# too, why not!
