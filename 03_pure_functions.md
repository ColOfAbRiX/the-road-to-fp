# Pure functions and referential transparency

## Simple examples of both concepts and counter examples

## Show that loops are not good, they require mutability

## Immutability as values that cannot cahnge

## Local mutabilty can be used

## Importance of pure function signatures

## Working with expressions

## Generating random numbers

## Memoization, or values as functions
